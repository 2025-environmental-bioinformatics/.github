# Environmental Bioinformatics 
Welcome to Environmental Bioinformatics! This is an intensive, hands-on course designed to give you an introduction to computational skills, and a survey of modern computational theory and approaches for the manipulation and analysis of genomic data in non-model systems. This course is designed to synthesize theory (both biological and computational) with hands-on programming to equip you to understand and carry out hypothesis testing with genomic data. 

This is our GitHub organization-- we will be using GitHub classrooms for assigning homework and for you to submit your homework. This doubles as good practice in using GitHub for your science.
